        <strong>UK saw some of the biggest rises in deaths rates in Europe in the months until the middle of June, official analysis shows.</strong> 
        <br><br>
        England saw the largest increase in death rates in Europe, with Scotland seeing the third largest increase.
        <br><br>
        The <strong><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020" target="_blank">Office for National Statistics says</a></strong> that Spain saw the highest peak in rates of death in Europe.
        <br><br>
        But the UK had the longest period of above-average deaths and so overall saw higher death rates.
